# Advice Generator
This is a project that uses vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to make a website  for an Advice Generator using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) that is responsive with a desktop view and a mobile view.

The inspiration for the design of the website was heavily inspired by a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db/hub/advice-generator-app-O45AmMGtPd) challenge.
